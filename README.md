# GmodEntitySpawner
Gmod Entity Spawner by Zaktak

### A Simple Addon that lets you set specific entities to specific models.
**Therefore can be used to allow jobs(darkRP jobs) to spawn entities.**
> *Why use this instead of entities.lua? - Well cause its simpler, doesn't
spawn kill you and isn't buggy as much.*

To configurate the addon simply edit the file called **"sh_enitityspawner.lua"** - *it is very simple.*
If you'd like to add/change further things hop in to the other files. They're filled with
comments to help you around. But, you will lose any support from me as I simply cannot look
around your files trying to find your errors.
