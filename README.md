# GmodEntitySpawner
Gmod Entity Spawner by Zaktak

To configurate the addon simply edit the file called "sh_enitityspawner.lua" - it is very simple.
If you'd like to add/change further things hop in to the other files. They're filled with
comments to help you around. But, you will lose any support from me as I simply cannot look
around your files trying to find your errors.
